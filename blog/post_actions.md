after running the `create.js` file, new docs will now be located under the `docs` directory.  
here are some steps to consider after running `create`:

- update logos and title in `docusaurus.config.js` file
- update theme color `--ifm-color-primary` in `./src/css/custom.css`
- add a rex badge to show your support: `[![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=created%20with%20rex&message=%F0%9F%A6%96&color=1e1e1e)](https://drex.netlify.app)`
