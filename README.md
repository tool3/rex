⚠️ ATTENTION! THIS WILL REWRITE YOUR GIT HISTORY! ⚠️    
use at your own risk

things to know:
- every `restory` command recreates the commit|s shas.
- you need to have a clean working directory.
- you will have to force push.
- when run without `--sha || -s` flag - the command will rewrite **ALL** commits with given input.
